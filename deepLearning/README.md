# Deep Learning - Convolutional Neural Networks

This sub-library details some of my explorations into deep neural networks. In particular into convolutional neural networks built in Pytorch
I have also utilised the wrapper Pytorch Lightning as a tool to simplify my code when teaching DL to beginners
The projects are Jupyter notebook files run in Google Colab to take advantage of their remote GPU for quicker training.

## Mini projects

1. MNIST number classification using Pytorch Lightning

2. Cat and Dog Image Classification using Pytorch Lightning

3. VGG16 Cat and Dog Image Classification using pure Pytorch
